Here is the high-level definition for the classes described above.

Enums, data types and constants: Here are the required enums, data types, and constants:

from enum import Enum


class BillItemType(Enum):
    BASE_CHARGE, ADDITIONAL_SERVICE, FINE, OTHER = 1, 2, 3, 4


class VehicleLogType(Enum):
    ACCIDENT, FUELING, CLEANING_SERVICE, OIL_CHANGE, REPAIR, OTHER = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6


class VanType(Enum):
    PASSENGER, CARGO = 1, 2


class CarType(Enum):
    ECONOMY, COMPACT, INTERMEDIATE, STANDARD, FULL_SIZE, PREMIUM, LUXURY = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7


class VehicleStatus(Enum):
    AVAILABLE, RESERVED, LOANED, LOST, BEING_SERVICED, OTHER = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6


class ReservationStatus(Enum):
    ACTIVE, PENDING, CONFIRMED, COMPLETED, CANCELLED, NONE = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6


class AccountStatus(Enum):
    ACTIVE, CLOSED, CANCELED, BLACKLISTED, BLOCKED = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

class Address:
    def __init__(self, street, city, state, zip_code, country):
        self.__street_address = street
        self.__city = city
        self.__state = state
        self.__zip_code = zip_code
        self.__country = country


class Person():
    def __init__(self, name, address, email, phone):
        self.__name = name
        self.__address = address
        self.__email = email
        self.__phone = phone


Account, Member, Receptionist, and Additional Driver: These classes represent different people that interact with our system:

from abc import ABC
from .constants import AccountStatus


# For simplicity, we are not defining getter and setter functions. The reader can
# assume that all class attributes are private and accessed through their respective
# public getter methods and modified only through their public methods function.


class Account(ABC):
    def __init__(self, id, password, person, status=AccountStatus.NONE):
        self.__id = id
        self.__password = password
        self.__status = AccountStatus.NONE
        self.__person = person

    def reset_password(self):
        None


class Member(Account):
    def __init__(self):
        self.__total_vehicles_reserved = 0

    def get_reservations(self):
        None


class Receptionist(Account):
    def __init__(self, date_joined):
        self.__date_joined = date_joined

    def search_member(self, name):
        None


class AdditionalDriver:
    def __init__(self, id, person):
        self.__driver_id = id
        self.__person = person


CarRentalSystem and CarRentalLocation: These classes represent the top level classes:
class CarRentalLocation:
    def __init__(self, name, address):
        self.__name = name
        self.__location = address

    def get_location(self):
        return self.__location


class CarRentalSystem:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.__name = name
        self.__locations = []

    def add_new_location(self, location):
        None


VehicleInventory and Search: VehicleInventory will implement an interface ‘Search’ to facilitate the searching of vehicles:
from abc import ABC


class Search(ABC):
    def search_by_type(self, type):
        None

    def search_by_model(self, model):
        None


class VehicleInventory(Search):
    def __init__(self):
        self.__vehicle_types = {}
        self.__vehicle_models = {}

    def search_by_type(self, query):
        # return all vehicles of the given type.
        return self.__vehicle_types.get(query)

    def search_by_model(self, query):
        # return all vehicles of the given model.
        return self.__vehicle_models.get(query)
